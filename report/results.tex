\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{General Findings}

\begin{itemize}
	\item A noise that interprets cooperation as defection decreases cooperation drastically.
	\item A noise that interprets defections as cooperations increases cooperation, but the effect is weaker.
	\item Perfect information is not what’s best for the system. If decisions are transmitted better than they are, the whole system gets more efficient.
	\item Friendly/cooperative players performance drastically decreases if the chance that cooperation is transmitted correct is less than 100\%.
	\item Players that do not react immediately to defections look non-responsive.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problem caused by unreliably transmitted cooperation}
Many of the friendly players perform well without noise, because they have an infinitely long sequence of mutual cooperations with other friendly players. Noise will trigger defections. This state requires then a way to come back into cooperation. Most cooperative players do not have a mechanism to reestablish cooperation if it has been destroyed, because they rely on a cooperation caused by the first turn decision being cooperative. 

\subsection{Benefit caused by unreliably transmitted defection}
Some players try out defective moves. For TFT mutants this can likely result in mutual defections. A noise that inserts cooperative moves results in the TFT player reacting cooperative again, driving the game in mutual cooperation again. Another thing is that hiding defections allows aggresive players to exploit players that would retaliate otherwise, and an aggresive player exploiting a weak one is better than if both players are defecting each other.

\subsection{Axelrods recommendations}
Axelrod proposed a certain behavior to be successful. This behavior is: Be Nice, Retaliatory, Forgiving and  Clear.  Under noise the opponent will see defections from a player, even if he never defected. This diminishes the use of being nice. It is more successful to find out if he responds to defections and exploit the opponent if he is exploitable. In Axelrods tournament this was not the case, because this attempt might have long lasting effects. However noise somewhat covers up the past. The other recommendations still hold.

\subsection{The Performance of each Player}
\begin{definition}[Noise]
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] \hspace{3mm}
	\item Nose 1 = Chance, that a cooperation gets received as defection
	\item Nose 2 = Chance, that a defection gets received as cooperation
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
The performance plots shows the average reward of a cerctain player, depending on the two noise levels. The simulation was run twice, therefor, each player has 2 performance graphs.

For most players there are tables that show how many of their moves are cooperative, dependant of the Noise levels under which the simulation was run. In this tables the entries in the first row have no Noise1 and the lower the row is the higher is Noise1. Noise2 is zero on the left side and gets higher for entries more on the right side. So the Noise 1 goes from 0 to 0.15 from top to bottom, and Noise2 goes from 0 to 0.15 from left to right.

\subsubsection{Cooperative Player}

The cooperative player's performance in both simulations is shown in figure~\ref{Pic Cooperative Player}.\\

\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{minipage}[hbt]{0.65\textwidth}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pics/simulation1/Reward_vs_Noise_of_Player_Cooperate}
\end{minipage}
\hfill

\end{minipage}
	\caption{Reward plot of the Cooperative Player}
	\label{Pic Cooperative Player}
\end{figure}

In a situation of no noise, this player performs strong against mostly friendly players, but gets exploited by aggressive players. In this situation it performs better than always defect, but similar to random.\\

Because this player is cooperative and not reactive Noise2 doesn't matter. On the other hand performance drastically decreases with Noise1. The seemingly inserted rejections make other players explore defective moves. Because the defective moves are not retaliated the other players might then stick with these defective moves. Players that start exploiting this player are Friedmann, Pavlov, CDowning and LookBack CDowning.\\

In a situation with noise this strategy is still strong with TFT mutants, because a cooperative interaction gets restored in the fastest possible way.\\

Still with a drop of 0.7 to 0.8 in performance this player is one of the players that is the most susceptible to noise overall.\\

Traits of the player:

\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{}

\begin{itemize}
	\item + Can sustain cooperation with friendly players even in noise
	\item - Exploitable
	\item - Does not respond to the opponents move
\end{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\bullet$}

\subsubsection{Defective Player}

The player's performance in both simulations is shown in figure~\ref{pic player defect}.\\

\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{minipage}[hbt]{0.65\textwidth}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pics/simulation1/Reward_vs_Noise_of_Player_Defect}
\end{minipage}
\hfill

\end{minipage}
	\caption{Reward plot of the Player Defect}
	\label{pic player defect}
\end{figure}

The player is so unfriendly, that Noise2 help him. A move where he can exploit the opponent gives him 5 times the reward of mutual defections, therefore even a small number of exploiting moves helps him a lot. If we would run the simulation with a Noise close to 50\% this player would become the most successful player. The performance increases in general against TFT mutants, but especially against players that try hard to avoid mutual defections, such as TF2T, reconciliation TFT, limited Reconciliation TFT. The strongest rise in performance comes against the player Evolutionary. \\

Traits of the player:

\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{}

\begin{itemize}
	\item + Can exploit players that do not respond
	\item + Performance increase with Noise
	\item - Ends up in mutual defections with most players

\end{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\bullet$}

\subsubsection{Random Player}
The player's performance in both simulations is shown in figure~\ref{pic player random}.\\
\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{minipage}[hbt]{0.65\textwidth}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pics/simulation1/Reward_vs_Noise_of_Player_Random}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[hbt]{0.3\textwidth}

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pics/simulation2/Reward_vs_Noise_of_Player_Random}
\end{minipage}
	\caption{Reward plot of the Random Player}
	\label{pic player random}
\end{figure}

The player does not get influenced that much by noise. There is a strange peak at zero noise, we were unable to find out why. If the noise makes his moves appear a little more cooperate there is a slight increase in performance, most likely due to more cooperative reactions from TFT mutants.

\subsubsection{Tit For Tat}
The player's performance in both simulations is shown in figure~\ref{pic player tit for tat}.\\
\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{minipage}[hbt]{0.65\textwidth}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pics/simulation1/Reward_vs_Noise_of_Player_Tit_for_tat}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[hbt]{0.3\textwidth}

\end{minipage}
	\caption{Reward plot of the Player Tit For Tat}
	\label{pic player tit for tat}
\end{figure}

Tit for Tat (TFT) is a rather strong player. He won Axelrod's tournaments that were without noise. For Noise1=0 he is one of the strongest of all players. These graphs above show that this player is extremely susceptible to noise1. The reason is that with no noise 1 he will always cooperate with other TFT mutants because the first move was cooperative. With noise the first move maters less. There are basically three states he can enter with himself.\\

\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{}

\begin{itemize}
	\item State 1: Mutual cooperation. Performance 3
	\item State 2: Alternating defection and cooperation. Performance 2.5
	\item State 3: Mutual defection. Performance 1
\end{itemize}

 A Noise1 signal changes the state from state 1 to state 2 or state 2 to state 3. Noise2 works in the other direction. The two noises are basically transition probabilities. For Noise1 greater than zero and Noise2 equal to zero the TFT ends up stuck in state three with itself. For equal noises in both directions TFT should be 50\% of the time in state 2 and 25\% in the states 1 and 3. This would imply the performance: 
$0.25*3+0.5*2.5+0.25*1=2.25$\\
Table~\ref{tab:tfttable} shows the performance of TFT against itself. Because the players in our simulation could only perform mirrored decisions state 2 was impossible and the actual performance was somewhat lower.

\begin{table}[h]
 \begin{center}
\caption{Performance of TFT playing against TFT}\label{tab:tfttable} \vspace{3mm}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}

 \hline
\end{tabular}
 \end{center}
\end{table}

Already at Noise1=0.05 the number of cooperative moves TFT performs drops from 40 to 80 percent. At higher Noise2 with no Noise1 the number of defections performed by TFT halves.\\

Traits of the player:

\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{}

\begin{itemize}
	\item + Responds fast
	\item + Not exploitable
	\item + Forgiving
	\item - Only accepts an apology, but does not initiate it himself, so he can stuck in mutual defections!
\end{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\bullet$}

\subsubsection{Friedmann}
The player's performance in both simulations is shown in figure~\ref{pic player friedmann}.\\
\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{minipage}[hbt]{0.65\textwidth}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pics/simulation1/Reward_vs_Noise_of_Player_Friedmann}
\end{minipage}
\hfill

\end{minipage}
	\caption{Reward plot of the Player Friedmann}
	\label{pic player friedmann}
\end{figure}

In the case of perfect information this player can profit from mutual cooperation with many players. In this case he performs well. However for any Noise1 greater than zero the player will receive a rejection at some point and therefore act like the player "Defect" most of the time. Friedmann generally tries to retaliate so hard on a rejection that the other player will not even attempt one rejection. However Friedmann cannot capitalise on this deterrent effect, because the moment the opponent realises it is already too late and he cannot know it in advance.\\

\begin{table}[h]
 \begin{center}
\caption{Cooperation of Friedmann dependant on the Noise} \vspace{3mm}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
   	& Noise 2 = 0 & Noise 2 = 0.05& Noise 2 = 0.1& Noise 2 = 0.15 \\
  \hline
  Noise 1 = 0 	& 0.6002&    0.6000&    0.6000 &   0.6000 \\
 \hline
  Noise 1 = 0.05	 & 0.0004&    0.0001 &   0.0001  &  0.0001 \\
 \hline
  Noise 1 = 0.10 	& 0.0001  &  0.0001&    0.0001 &   0.00016 \\
 \hline
  Noise 1 = 0.15 	& 0.0001  &  0.0001  &  0.0001  &  0.0001 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
 \end{center}
\end{table}

As soon as Noise1 is greater than 0 the number of cooperative moves goes to zero. But already at zero noise Friedmann only has 60\% cooperative moves, while TFT has 80\%.\\


Traits of the player:

\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{}

\begin{itemize}
	\item + Stays in mutual cooperation with friendly players when Noise1 is zero
	\item - Completely breaks down with Noise1 greater than zero
\end{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\bullet$}

\subsubsection{Pavlov}
The player's performance in both simulations is shown in figure~\ref{pic player pavlov}.\\
\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{minipage}[hbt]{0.65\textwidth}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pics/simulation1/Reward_vs_Noise_of_Player_Pavlov}
\end{minipage}

\end{minipage}
	\caption{Reward plot of the Player pavlov}
	\label{pic player pavlov}
\end{figure}

Pavlov performs rather well without Noise1. If Noise1 is greater then zero, some players realise that defections against Pavlov work as well as cooperations. Pure defect against Pavlov results in the rewards 5 1 5 1 5 1 for the opponent, while pure cooperation results in 3 3 3 3, given Pavlov is cooperative when the opponent started playing random. With zero noise the opponent gets an average reward of 3 for cooperation and defection but with noise the performance of cooperation decreases (because Pavlov retaliates). Players that largely start to defect against Pavlov are:  Friedmann, Tit for average Tat, CDowning, LookBack CDowning and the Strategy switcher.

\begin{table}[h]
 \begin{center}
\caption{Cooperation of Pavlov depending on the Noise} \vspace{3mm}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
   	& Noise 2 = 0 & Noise 2 = 0.05& Noise 2 = 0.1& Noise 2 = 0.15 \\
  \hline
  Noise 1 = 0 	&     0.8239 &   0.8488&    0.8541&    0.8037 \\
 \hline
  Noise 1 = 0.05	 &   0.4885  &  0.5433 &   0.5697  &  0.5860 \\
 \hline
  Noise 1 = 0.10 	& 0.4939  &  0.5211 &   0.5338 &   0.5455 \\
 \hline
  Noise 1 = 0.15 	& 0.5063    &0.5187  &  0.5251 &   0.5319 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
 \end{center}
\end{table}

Without Noise 1 the number of Cooperative moves is around 80\% while it is around 50\% with Noise 1. It is interessting that with Noise2 but no Noise1 Pavlov is less cooperative than TFT.\\


Traits of the player:

\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{}
\begin{itemize}
	\item + Forgives fast
	\item + Initializes cooperation out of mutual defection
	\item + Not exploitable without noise
	\item - Too many cooperative moves against defecting players
	\item - Not retaliating (pure defect and pure cooperation perform equally well)
\end{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\bullet$}

\subsubsection{Tit For 2 Tat}
The player's performance in both simulations is shown in the two figures below:
\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{minipage}[hbt]{0.65\textwidth}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pics/simulation1/Reward_vs_Noise_of_Player_Tit_for_2tat}

\end{minipage}
	\caption{Reward plot of the Player Tit For 2 Tat}
	\label{pic player tf2t}
\end{figure}

As a TFT mutant it has a similar performance. The difference is that this player is more forgiving. The bad thing is that this makes him exploitable. The better thing is that it is more robust to Noise1 as it does not react to single defections. The player still ends up in mutual defections with itself if Noise2 is zero and Noise1 greater than zero, but for both Noises greater than zero the player plays much stronger against itself. At zero noise the performance of TF2T is worse than the one of TFT, but with Noise1 their performances are similar. The effect that players like "Evolutionary" will exploit TF2T seems to balance out with the better resistance to noise.

\begin{table}[h]
 \begin{center}
\caption{Cooperation of TF2T depending on the Noise} \vspace{3mm}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
   	& Noise 2 = 0 & Noise 2 = 0.05& Noise 2 = 0.1& Noise 2 = 0.15 \\
  \hline
  Noise 1 = 0 	&        0.8271&    0.8796 &   0.8880  & 0.8947 \\
 \hline
  Noise 1 = 0.05	 &       0.5366  &  0.7450  &  0.7712 &   0.7926 \\
 \hline
  Noise 1 = 0.10 	&    0.5132 &   0.7349  &  0.7375&   0.7622 \\
 \hline
  Noise 1 = 0.15 	&     0.4864 &   0.6503 &   0.6977   & 0.72749 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
 \end{center}
\end{table}

The cooperation stays much higher than for TFT especially if Noise2 also is not zero.

Traits different to TFT:

\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{}
\begin{itemize}
	\item + More Forgiving
	\item - More Exploitable
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Joss}
The player's performance in both simulations is shown in the two figures below:
\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{minipage}[hbt]{0.65\textwidth}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pics/simulation1/Reward_vs_Noise_of_Player_Joss}

\end{minipage}
	\caption{Reward plot of the Player Joss}
	\label{pic player joss}
\end{figure}

While this is a TFT mutant, its performance dependence on noise looks totally different. The player generally performs poorly. At some noises this player is able to exploit TF2T (Noise2 greater than 0 and Noise1 0) however most of the time the retaliation of the defections outweighs their gain. TFT is very susceptible to Noise1 and Joss makes himself look like under Noise1 to his opponent. It is interesting that the performance of this player looks like the performance of "Defect" just shifted about 0.5 upwards.

\begin{table}[h]
 \begin{center}
\caption{Cooperation of Joss depending on the Noise} \vspace{3mm}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
   	& Noise 2 = 0 & Noise 2 = 0.05& Noise 2 = 0.1& Noise 2 = 0.15 \\
  \hline
  Noise 1 = 0 	&            0.3983  &  0.5300  &  0.6102  &  0.6172 \\
 \hline
  Noise 1 = 0.05	 &          0.3983 &   0.5300  &  0.6102 &  0.6172 \\
 \hline
  Noise 1 = 0.10 	&        0.2968  &  0.4026  &  0.4625    &0.5006 \\

  Noise 1 = 0.15 	&     0.2404    &0.3720 &   0.4225  &  0.4591 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
 \end{center}
\end{table}

With higher Noise2 some cooperation can be achieved, but generally the player is mostly defecting.

\subsubsection{Diekmann}
The player's performance in both simulations is shown in the two figures below:
\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{minipage}[hbt]{0.65\textwidth}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pics/simulation1/Reward_vs_Noise_of_Player_Diekmann}

\end{minipage}
	\caption{Reward plot of the Player Diekmann}
	\label{pic player diekmann}
\end{figure}

This is a TFT mutant, that performs on the same level as TFT at no noise, and is therefore one of the strongest players if there is no noise. While his performance also drops with Noise1 the effect is much less severe. For Noise1=0.05 and Noise2=0, TFT drops about 0.9, while Diekmann only drops 0.5. This player actually initiates cooperation and gets not stuck in mutual defection with TFT mutants. The weakness of this player is that he is exploitable by defective moves every 10 moves. However on our simulation we haven't seen a player exploiting this weakness. Evolutionary could exploit it if the period in which the algorithm updates would be a multiple of the period in which Diekmann inserts cooperative moves.

\begin{table}[h]
 \begin{center}
\caption{Cooperation of Diekmann depending on the noise} \vspace{3mm}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
   	& Noise 2 = 0 & Noise 2 = 0.05& Noise 2 = 0.1& Noise 2 = 0.15 \\
  \hline
  Noise 1 = 0 	&               0.8635 &   0.9034   & 0.9113 &  0.8741 \\
 \hline
  Noise 1 = 0.05	 &            0.7157 &   0.7263  &  0.7200  &  0.7359 \\
 \hline
  Noise 1 = 0.10 	&           0.6230  &  0.6500  &  0.6655 &   0.6946 \\

 \hline
\end{tabular}
 \end{center}
\end{table}

The cooperation drops not nearly as much with the Noise as this is the case for TFT, he even is much more cooperative at no noise. At low noise2 values he is more cooperative than TF2T, but when both noises get high TF2T is more cooperative.

Traits different to TFT:

\subsubsection{Tit For Average Tat}
The player's performance in both simulations is shown in the two figures below:
\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{minipage}[hbt]{0.65\textwidth}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pics/simulation1/Reward_vs_Noise_of_Player_Tit_for_average_tat}

\end{minipage}
	\caption{Reward plot of the Player Tit For Average Tat}
	\label{pic player tfat}
\end{figure}

This TFT mutant looks very similar to Diekmann and other friendlier TFT mutants. The fact that it reacts to the players average move during the last turns allows him to ignore some of the noise. The problem is that if mutual defection appears it is just as hard to get out of it as it was to get into it. Maybe this players performance would have decreased if the simulation was run even longer. In general this player performs about as well as Reconciliation TFT and a little bit worse than Diekmann. Theoretically this player is exploitable. 

\begin{table}[h]
 \begin{center}
\caption{Cooperation of Tit For Average Tat depending on the noise} \vspace{3mm}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
   	& Noise 2 = 0 & Noise 2 = 0.05& Noise 2 = 0.1& Noise 2 = 0.15 \\
  \hline
  Noise 1 = 0 	&    0.8056  &  0.8404  &  0.8456  &  0.8547 \\
 \hline
  Noise 1 = 0.05	 &     0.5316  &  0.6170 &   0.6140   & 0.6863 \\
 \hline
  Noise 1 = 0.10 	&    0.4712  &  0.4860  &  0.5100  &  0.5985 \\
 \hline
  Noise 1 = 0.15 	&       0.3419  &  0.4134 &   0.4660 &   0.5098 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
 \end{center}
\end{table}

The cooperation drops surprisingly fast with Noise1, but still not as fast as for TFT. The number of cooperative moves is still more similar to TFT than Diekmann. This is surprising, that the performances look so close, while the underlying moves are so different. Diekmanns very nice approach seems to be just as efficient as TFAT's more retaliating method. 

Traits of the player:

\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{}
\begin{itemize}
	\item + ignores single moves

\subsubsection{Reconciliation Tit for Tat}
The player's performance in both simulations is shown in the two figures below:

	\caption{Reward plot of the Player Reconciliation Tit For Tat}
	\label{pic player rtft}
\end{figure}

Like other more forgiving TFT mutants he has similar performance to TFT without noise, and drops less with noise1. The disadvantage of this player is that while it is not exploitable it still performs worse against defective players, when its reconciliation attempts are shut down over and over again.

\begin{table}[h]
 \begin{center}
\caption{Cooperation of Reconcilation Tit For Tat depending on the noise} \vspace{3mm}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
   	& Noise 2 = 0 & Noise 2 = 0.05& Noise 2 = 0.1& Noise 2 = 0.15 \\
  \hline
  Noise 1 = 0 	&  0.8728  &  0.8972  &  0.9033 &   0.8723 \\

 \hline
\end{tabular}
 \end{center}
\end{table}

The number of cooperations is very high even with high noise1, at noise1=0.15 it's cooperation is higher than that of most TFT mutants. Generally the number of cooperative moves is more similar to Diekmann than to TFAT.

\end{minipage}
	\caption{Reward plot of the Player DDowning}
	\label{pic player dd}
\end{figure}

If Noise1 is zero, then CDownig performs stronger than DDowning. DDowning performs generally poorly with high Noise2 and no Noise1 there is a slight performance gain. At no noise DDowning outperforms CDowning against "Cooperate" and "Watcher", but is much worse against all TFT mutants and Friedmann. Noise2 improves the performance of DDowning against the TFT mutants a little. In the individual parings it seems that DDowning can end up in either mutual rejection or mutual cooperation. The decision where they end up seems to be random. For example at Noise2=0.15 mutual cooperation appears in TFT and TF2T, but not in Diekmann and Joss, while at Noise2=0.1 it is the other way around.

\begin{table}[h]

 \hline
\end{tabular}
 \end{center}
\end{table}

DDowning seems to reject almost all the time, while CDowning rejects most of the time if Noise1 is greater than 0. A problem of Downing is that it compares decisions that hapen at the same time, but at this time the opponent does not know Downings decision, so his decision can only be dependant on Downings past decisions.

There were too many unfriendly players, that any player could have been friendly enough so that this player would have looked over a defection. The only player that would cooperate enough is "Cooperate". Against this player the number of cooperations was higher then the one of TFT, but because "Cooperate" is an exploitable player, this actually hurt this strategy.
In an environement where most players are cooperating this player could theoretically be exploited.

\subsubsection{Strategy Switcher}

\end{minipage}
	\caption{Reward plot of the Player Strategy Switcher}
	\label{pic player ss}
\end{figure}

This player was by far the strongest player before the Downing players were added to the simulation. In the final simulation he is strong in fields, where the Noise is large as is performance is not impacted by noise. The disadvantage comes from trying out different strategies in the beginning. In the case of no noise this means that Friedmann will always defect. In the case of Downing mutants this seems to result in defections from the Downing players. Before these Downing players were added this player outperformed TFt by a huge margin, even at zero noise. The strength of this player comes from his ability to cooperate with TFT mutants and exploit exploitable players. This player might even be stronger if better strategies were given to his arsenal. Currently he had "Cooperate", "Defect", TFT, TF2T and Pavlov as choices. A more efficient choice might have been Limited Reconciliation TFT and "Defect". Currently it also contains exploitable strategies (TF2T), so the player could be exploited.

In long simulations the player can benefit from having the optimal strategy, while in short simulations he spends a large amount of the time trying out strategies that might not be very strong.

\begin{table}[h]
 \begin{center}
\caption{Cooperations of Strategy Switcher depending on the Noise} \vspace{3mm}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}

   	& Noise 2 = 0 & Noise 2 = 0.05& Noise 2 = 0.1& Noise 2 = 0.15 \\

 \hline
\end{tabular}
 \end{center}
\end{table}

The number of cooperations is rather low, but also does not change very much with the noise. The number of cooperations is most likely low, because this player actively looks if an opponent is exploitable.

\end{minipage}
	\caption{Reward plot of the Player Lookback DDowning}
	\label{pic player lbdd}
\end{figure}

Generally both Lookback Downings are stronger than the not Lookback Downings. If Noise1 is zero, the CDowning mutant has again a higher performance. Comparing the second last move with the last move of the opponent seems to be the better way to correlate your actions with your opponent's actions. DDowning seems to be very resilient to Noise.

At zero noise CDowning performs well with most players, except "Evolutionary", Strategy Switcher, and some Downing mutants. With noise the performance against Friedmann and some Downing mutants that went well before drops. The overall performance however stays higher than TFT. The Look-back Downing behaves similar like Lookback CDowning behaves with noise.

\end{table}

The number of Cooperations is in general much higher then for the Variants that do not look-back. For Noise1 greater than zero about 40\% cooperative moves remain, while CDowning and DDowning fall down to 5-10\% cooperative moves. The average rewards for these players are also 0.2-0.5 higher then their not look-back counterparts.

	\label{pic player watcher}
\end{figure}

This player generally does not perform very strong. It does not respond and can therefore be exploited. It also does not take the local situation into account. It will betray Friedmann even in no Noise, because in short term this is successful. After that the player copies strategies that were cooperative the whole time, while Friedmann is defecting. There is point of higher performance, where Noise2 is 0.15 and Noise 1 is zero. For some reason it performs strong against the Lookback-Downing algorithms.

\end{figure}

This player performs rather poorly at all noises. Less Noise is better for him, because more reliable information allows the player to adjust. Noise generally promotes bad strategies, while they are sorted out when there is little noise. The problem is that this players does add rejections and therefore triggers others rejections. The player himself has a very slow reaction time. Changing his strategy by mutations takes hundreds of turns. This is a stimescale the opponents cannot see. To the opponents this player does not look responsive. The player himself can only see the opponents reaction if it is within the segment legnth that the player tries to optimize. The interesting thing is that this player is able to exploit TF2T, he will add defections with mostly one sometimes two cooperative steps between them. It has a performance of 3.65 against TF2T at zero noise.

\begin{table}[h]
 \begin{center}
\caption{Cooperations of the Evolutionary depending on the Noise} \vspace{3mm}

The decisions seem to be mostly an even mix of defections and cooperations, with a slight preference of defections.

\end{figure}

At noise1 equal to zero the performance is similar to TFT. It does not perform as well as Reconciliation TFT against Joss, therefore it might be wiser to make the time between the reconciliation attempts larger every time, instead of limiting it to 3. Compared to TFT its performance does not break down that much with noise1, this is a property it shares with Diekmann, TFAT and Reconciliation TFT. The fact that the number of reconciliation attempts is limited makes the player stronger against defecting players like Friedmann (under noise1) and "Defect".

It is not as cooperative as the friendliest TFT mutants Diekmann and RTFT, but more friendly than standard TFT and TFAT.

At higher values for Noise1, LTFT outperforms TFT, while at high Noise2 values the reconciliation attempts are not needed, because the noise itself achieves that.

Noise 1 seems to destroy cooperation really fast, while Noise2 increases it a little. Generally the average reward is the highest if the number of cooperative moves is the highest. The Average Rewards dependence on the noise looks very similar to the values a typical TFT mutant has. This may be related to the fact, that there were 8 TFT mutants in the simulation.

\subsection{Comparison of the players}

Best strategy at each Noise:

\end{minipage}	\caption{Reward versus Noise with the best players}
	\label{pic player best}
\end{figure}

At Noise1 equal zero the TFT mutants win, but for every noise1 larger than zero the strategy switcher wins, due to the small impact noise has on his performance.

In the following graphs the players performances are compared at zero noise, Noise1=0 and Noise2=0.15, Noise1=0.1 and Noise1=0 and both noises 0.1. The results are from the first simulation run.

Comparison of all players at zero noise:

	\label{pic player noise1}
\end{figure}

With no noise the best strategies are either TFT mutants, or variants of CDowning. Defective strategies perform poorly. This is in accordance to what Axelrod said: “Be nice”.

Noise1=0, Noise2=0.1

\end{minipage}	\caption{Reward of players with both noises equals to zero}

\end{figure}

The ranking of the different strategies does not change much. Generally everybody is profiting of the noise.
Noise1=0.1, Noise2=0

\end{figure}

The performance of the TFT mutants drastically decreases. Only Diekmann stays somewhat high. The strongest strategies are now the Lookback Downing and the strategy switcher. The strategy switcher before had the problem that the defections he tried out to exploit non-responding players cost him a lot. Now everybody sees defections due to the noise and it doesn’t matter that much anymore.

Noise1=0.1, Noise2=0.1

\end{figure}

The TFT mutants perform somewhat better than without Noise2, but the strategy switcher is still much stronger than the competition.
