\section{Summary and Outlook}
The aim of this simulation was to investigate two things. The first was the impact of noise on the tournament. It turned out that Noise that lets Defections appear as cooperations is beneficial for most players. The opposite, when cooperative moves are perceived as defections, has a much larger impact. The performance of most friendly players drastically drops. It is especially harsh for players that relied on the effect of the first move being cooperative and have no mechanism to restore cooperation once it is lost.

The second investigated topic was how learning players would perform. Of the three learning mechanisms, copying others, Evolution and Strategy switching, Strategy switching performed the strongest. The strategy was also stronger than most not learning strategies. The other two approaches failed, because they were not responsive.

Outlook: The performance of the players was heavily impacted by the nature of the other players participating in the simulation. It would be interesting to run the simulation with more players. Another possible investigation could be to find out if the average performance increases with a noise that covers up defections forever, or if there is a turning point after which the performance decreases again.
