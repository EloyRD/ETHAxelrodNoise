% Content of file:
% 1.cell: initialization
% 2.cell: plot reward of all players with given noiselevels
% 3.cell: plot cooperation of all players with given noiselevels
% 4.cell: plot statistics for a given player (reward vs given noiselevels)
% with surface plot
% 5.cell: plot statistics for a given player (cooperation vs given
% noiselevels) with surfac plot
% 6.cell: reward vs noise with name of the best player in plot
% 7.cell: total cooperation/reward normed with surface plot
% 8.cell: 2 given Players against each other 

% Use of file:
% 1. set filename of the simulation file in the 1. cell 
% 2. set desired noiselevel in the 2.cell
% 3. set desired noiselevel in the 3.cell
% 4. set desired positions of players and desired noiselevels in the 4.cell
% 5. set desired positions of players and desired noiselevels in the 5.cell
% 6. set playersInRange true in the 6.cell to write the players in range
% in a textfile
% 7. set the filename for the players in range in the 6.cell
% 8. set the range in the 6.cell
% 9. set the filename in the 7.cell for the file with the 2 matrices
%10. set the desired players to face each other
%11. run the whole file

% hint: just run one cell, if only this result is desired
% warning: the more things you want to plot, the more plots you got
