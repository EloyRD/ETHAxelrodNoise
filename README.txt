General Introduction

Tournament like simulation of the prisoner's dilemma with repeated inter-
actions. Random errors are introduced in the information about the player's 
recent behavior. We want to observe the different outcome of the traditional
players if noise is introduced. Further we want to try to implement new 
players with learning strategies. 

We believe that this makes the simulation more realistic. 

Extension of Axelrod's Tournaments.

Fundamental Questions

Can a dispute based on miscommunication be overcome?
Can treason be hidden behind pretended miscommunication?
Does miscommunication discourage cooperation?
How much miscommunication can cooperation survive?
Do learning strategies have an advantage over the other ones?
How do the traditional players act and how does the final result change, 
if noise is introduced?

Independent variables: length of simulation, reliability of communication, 
rewards
Dependent variables: correlation between cooperation and success, frequency 
of cooperation, successful strategies

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Expected Results

Miscommunication works against cooperating strategies. 
Programs that reconcile are more successful.
The reward of the learning players is less influenced by the noise.
